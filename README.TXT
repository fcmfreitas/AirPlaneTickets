Our project is about simulating an airplane ticket sale, in which the
user must choose his destination. There are three options available: the 
city of Rio de Janeiro, SÃ£o Paulo and Salvador. In order to go through 
the first steps, the user must insert his full name and CPF. After that, 
it is possible to choose the amount of seats you want to buy.
