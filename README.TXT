Our project is about simulating an airplane ticket sale, in which the
user must choose the location he wants to go. The options are: the city
of Rio de Janeiro, SÃ£o Paulo and Salvador. In order to go through the 
first steps, the user must insert his full name and CPF. After that, the
user can choose the amount of seats he wants to buy.
